# Yoga with Carmen
[View the live project here](https://yoga-with-carmen.herokuapp.com/)

Yoga with Carmen is a website built for the yoga teacher Carmen Ferraro. The website allows Carmen to showcase her work, publish classes, set maximum available spaces, and display them on a calendar. Users can sign up, view, comment, and like posts, book classes, and comment on their reservations. The purpose of the website is mainly informative. It provides an exhaustive description of the disciplines practiced, allowing users who want to start a yoga journey to have a better understanding of the courses.
Yoga with Carmen targets people interested in yoga and would like to start or keep practicing it; it also targets people with physical pain problems due to bad posture and helps them resolve them through exercise.

## DESIGN PLANNING:
The design of the website has been implemented using Balsamiq wireframes. The wireframes allowed me to sketch prototypes of the web pages so that I had a clear visual idea of how the website should have looked like.

- A payment system to buy lessons packages;
- A feature to buy a package and send it as a gift, making sure that only one device can access it.

## Testing:

- I have conducted the testing of all models, forms, and views HTTPResponses using the Django built-in tool Unittes. From settings.py I commented out the Postgres DATABASE and used instead:
**DATABASES = {**
  **'default': {**
      **'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',**
      **'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',**
  **}**
**}**

### Manual Testing
- I have conducted manual testing using print statements and/or checking the outcomes on the browser. 
The results are described underneath:

- [The W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator): I tested my css by direct input.

- [JSHint](https://jshint.com/):
The testing presented two warnings: "Expected an assignment or function call and instead saw an expression." and considered 'bootstrap' an undefined variable. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to resolve the issues. I have tested the functions manually, using print statements and the results on the browser, and the code works as expected.

- PEP8 
No errors were returned when passing through the official [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/);

## Bugs:
- In script.js, when I tried to retrieve elements by the class name "day" and access their values, I was relating to them as if they were a single value, which led to an error. 
I later realized that the request was receiving an HTMLCollection, and to access it I needed to iterate through the elements. Using a for loop fixed the issue.

- After adding the notes form I realized that the reservation field (from which select the reservation the note has to refer to) was presenting too many options. The possible reservations weren't just the logged-in user's reservations but all users. Adding a filter to the queryset of the reservation field fixed the problem.

- When writing the function reduce_available_spaces the available_spaces value of the relevant class was reduced temporarily.
When the function was called again, it was starting from the initial value. Simply saving the class fixed the problem.

## Ongoing bugs:
During testing, I realized that when I tried to retrieve the password, the website was crushing, and the system wasn't allowing me to reset it. I then deleted the 'forgot password?' link to prevent the issue, but I haven't found a solution to fix the bug.

## Deployment:
- Log into Heroku;
- On the dashboard, click on **New**;
- Click the **Create new app** button;
- Name your app by typing the chosen name under **App name**;
- Select your region and click the **Create app** button;
- Create a database in ElephantSql.com;
- Log in to ElephantSQL to access your dashboard;
- Click **Create New Instance**;
- Set up your plan by giving your plan a name (the name of the project);
- Select the Tiny Turtle (Free) plan
- You can leave the Tags field blank
- Click on **Select Region** and select a data center near you;
- Click the **Review** button;
- Check your details are correct and then click **Create instance**;
- Return to the ElephantSQL dashboard and click on the database name for this project;
- In the URL section, click the copy icon to copy the database URL;
- In your project workspace, create a file called env.py; 
- Make sure that this file is included in the .gitignore file;
- In the env.py file type **import.os**;
- Set the environment variables: add a blank line, then set a **DATABASE_URL** variable, with the value you just copied from ElephantSQL following this format:**os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]="copied URL from ElephantSQL"**;
- Add a **SECRET_KEY** following this format: **os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "my^secret@key"**;
- Make sure you save the file;
- Open up your settings.py file and add the following code below your Path import: **import os**
 **import dj_database_url**
 **if os.path.isfile('env.py'):**
     **import env**
- A little further down, remove the secret key provided by Django;
- Reference the variable in the env.py file, so change your SECRET_KEY variable to the following: **SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')**;
- Scroll down in your settings file to the database section and comment out the original DATABASES variable;
- Add this code below: **DATABASES = {**
    **'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get****("DATABASE_URL"))**
 **}**
- Make sure you save your file;
- Run the migration command in your terminal to migrate your database structure to the newly-connected ElephantSQL database:
 **python3 manage.py migrate**;
- Once the migrations have been completed, head back over to your ElephantSQL dashboard, select your database instance and then select the “Browser” tab on the left;
- Click **Table queries** to reveal a dropdown list, you can see your database structure here;
- Add, commit and push your project to GitHub;
- Go back to the Heroku dashboard and open the Settings tab;
- On the menu bar, click on **Settings**;
- In the **Config Vars** section, click on **Reveal Config Vars**;
- In the field for **KEY** enter **DATABASE_URL**;
- In the field for **VALUE** copy in your database URL from ElephantSQL, and click **Add**;
- In the field for **KEY** enter **SECRET_KEY**;
- In the field for **VALUE** copy the secret key that you used in the env.py file, and click **Add**;
- Add another Config Var underneath by entering **PORT** in the **KEY** field, **8000** in the VALUE field, and clicking the **Add** button;
-  Add your Heroku hostname into **ALLOWED_HOSTS** in our settings.py file in this format: **ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['hostname', 'localhost']**;
- In the root of your workspace create **Procfile**;
- Inside **Procfile** add the following code: **web: gunicorn projectname.wsgi**
- Save files, add, commit and push your project to GitHub;
- Go back to the Heroku dashboard;
- Scroll up to the main menu bar and click on **Deploy**;
- In the **Deployment method** section, select **GitHub**;
- Click **Connect to GitHub**;
- Enter the name of your repository in the search bar and click **Search**;
- Once your repository it's shown underneath, click on **Connect**;
- Scroll down to the **Manual deploy** section;
- Click on **Deploy branch**;
- Wait until you see the message **Your app was successfully deployed**;
- Click on **View** to make sure your mock terminal is up and running.
